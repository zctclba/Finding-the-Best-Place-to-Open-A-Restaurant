# I will use the location data of New York and Toronto provided in Module 3, clean and reformat the datasets, pull the coordinates of each neighborhood, 
get the features of their neighborhoods using Foursquare API, segment and cluster their neighborhoods into 5 clusters. 
Then compare and analyze the features of these clusters, and find the best place to open a restaurant either in New York or Toronto.

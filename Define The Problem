New York City and Toronto are two of the most important financial and cultural cities in North America. These two cities are not geographically far from each other. 
They have a lot similarities and differences from the business and social perspective. 

Someone is looking to open a restaurant in either New York or Toronto. In this research, I am going to segment and cluster the neighborhoods of these two cities, 
analyze their features, compare their similarities and differences, and find the best neighborhood in one of the two cities to open the restaurant.
